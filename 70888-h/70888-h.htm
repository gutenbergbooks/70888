<p class="nind">
<span class="dropcap">T</span>he discovery of the aberration of light was
soon followed by an explanation according to the emission theory. The
effect was attributed to a simple composition of the velocity of light with
the velocity of the earth in its orbit. The difficulties in this apparently
sufficient explanation were overlooked until after an explanation on the
undulatory theory of light was proposed. This new explanation was at first
almost as simple as the former. But it failed to account for the fact
proved by experiment that the aberration was unchanged when observations
were made with a telescope filled with water. For if the tangent of the
angle of aberration is the ratio of the velocity of the earth to the
velocity of light, then, since the latter velocity in water is
three-fourths its velocity in a vacuum, the aberration observed with a
water telescope should be four-thirds of its true value.<a id="FNanchor_2_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_1" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>
</p>
<p>
On the undulatory theory,
according to Fresnel, first, the æther is supposed to be at rest except
in the interior of transparent media, in which secondly, it is supposed
to move with a velocity less than the velocity of the medium in the ratio
<img style="vertical-align: -1.654ex; width: 7.238ex; height: 5.07ex;" src="images/1.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\dfrac{n^{2}-1}{n^{2}}">, where <img style="vertical-align: -0.025ex; width: 1.357ex; height: 1.025ex;" src="images/2.svg" alt=" " data-tex="n"> is the index of refraction. These
two hypotheses give a complete and satisfactory explanation of aberration.
The second hypothesis, notwithstanding its seeming improbability, must
be considered as fully proved, first, by the celebrated experiment of
Fizeau,<a id="FNanchor_3_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_1" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>
and secondly, by the ample confirmation of our own work.<a id="FNanchor_4_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_1" class="fnanchor">[4]</a>.
The experimental trial of the first hypothesis forms the subject of the
present paper.
</p>
<p>
If the earth were a transparent body, it might perhaps be conceded, in
view of the experiments just cited, that the inter-molecular æther was
at rest in space, notwithstanding the motion of the earth in its orbit;
but we have no right to extend the conclusion from these experiments to
opaque bodies. But there can hardly be question that the æther can and
does pass through metals. Lorentz cites the illustration of a metallic
barometer tube. When the tube is inclined the æther in the space above
the mercury is certainly forced out, for it is imcompressible.<a id="FNanchor_5_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_1" class="fnanchor">[5]</a>.
But again we have no right to assume that it makes its escape with perfect
freedom, and if there be any resistance, however slight, we certainly
could not assume an opaque body such as the whole earth to offer free
passage through its entire mass. But as Lorentz aptly remarks: "Quoi
qu'il en soit, on fera bien, à mon avis, de ne pas se laisser guider,
dans une question aussi importante, par des considérations sur le
degré de probabilité ou de simplicité de l'une ou de l'autre
hypothèse, mais de s'addresser a l'expérience pour apprendre à
connaitre l'état, de repos ou de mouvement, dans lequel se trouve
l'æther à la surface terrestre."<a id="FNanchor_6_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_1" class="fnanchor">[6]</a>
</p>
<p>
In April, 1881, a method was proposed and carried out for testing the
question experimentally.<a id="FNanchor_7_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_1" class="fnanchor">[7]</a>
</p>
<p>
In deducing the formula for the quantity to be measured, the effect of
the motion of the earth through the æther on the path of the ray at
right angles to this motion was overlooked.<a id="FNanchor_8_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_1" class="fnanchor">[8]</a>
The discussion of this oversight and of the entire experiment forms the
subject of a very searching analysis by H. A. Lorentz,<a id="FNanchor_9_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_1" class="fnanchor">[9]</a>,
who finds that this effect can by no means be disregarded. In consequence,
the quantity to be measured had in fact but one-half the value supposed,
and as it was already barely beyond the limits of errors of experiment, the
conclusion drawn from the result of the experiment might well be
questioned; since, however, the main portion of the theory remains
unquestioned, it was decided to repeat the experiment with such
modifications as would insure a theoretical result much too large to be
masked by experimental errors. The theory of the method may be briefly
stated as follows:&mdash;
</p>
<p>
Let <img style="vertical-align: -0.023ex; width: 2.258ex; height: 1.023ex;" src="images/3.svg" alt=" " data-tex="sa">, fig. 1, be a ray of light which is partly reflected in <img style="vertical-align: -0.025ex; width: 2.167ex; height: 1.595ex;" src="images/4.svg" alt=" " data-tex="ab">,

does not affect the validity of the reasoning. Let it now be required to
find the difference in the two paths <img style="vertical-align: -0.8ex; width: 4.352ex; height: 2.37ex;" src="images/20.svg" alt=" " data-tex="aba_{/}">, and <img style="vertical-align: -0.8ex; width: 4.361ex; height: 1.8ex;" src="images/21.svg" alt=" " data-tex="aca_{/}">.

neglecting terms of the fourth order. The length of the other path is
evidently <img style="vertical-align: -1.693ex; width: 13.946ex; height: 5.566ex;" src="images/30.svg" alt=" " data-tex="2D{\sqrt{(1+{\dfrac {v^{2}}{V^{2}}}}}"> or to the same degree

is therefore <img style="vertical-align: -1.679ex; width: 5.73ex; height: 5.095ex;" src="images/32.svg" alt=" " data-tex="D{\dfrac {v^{2}}{V^{2}}}">. If now the whole apparatus be
turned through <img style="vertical-align: -0.05ex; width: 3.226ex; height: 1.645ex;" src="images/33.svg" alt=" " data-tex="90^{o}">, the difference will be in the opposite
direction, hence the displacement of the interference-fringes should be

its orbit, this would be <img style="vertical-align: -0.05ex; width: 10.265ex; height: 2.005ex;" src="images/35.svg" alt=" " data-tex="2D \times 10^{-8}">. If, as was the case in the
first experiment, <img style="vertical-align: -0.186ex; width: 12.037ex; height: 2.14ex;" src="images/36.svg" alt=" " data-tex="D = 2 \times 10^{6}"> waves of yellow light, the
displacement to be expected would be <img style="vertical-align: -0.05ex; width: 4.023ex; height: 1.581ex;" src="images/37.svg" alt=" " data-tex="0.04"> of the distance between the
interference fringes.
</p>
<p>
In the first experiment one of the principal difficulties encountered
was that of revolving the apparatus without producing distortion; and
another was its extreme sensitiveness to vibration. This was so great
that it was impossible to see the interference fringes except at brief
intervals when working in the city, even at two o'clock in the morning.
Finally, as before remarked, the quantity to be observed, namely, a
displacement of something less than a twentieth of the distance between
the interference fringes may have been too small to be detected when
masked by experimental errors. The first named difficulties were
entirely overcome by mounting the apparatus on a massive stone floating
on mercury; and the second by increasing, by repeated reflection, the
path of the light to about ten times its former value.

The apparatus is represented in perspective in fig. 3, in plan in fig.
4, and in vertical section in fig. 5.

so disposed that light from an argand burner <img style="vertical-align: -0.023ex; width: 1.197ex; height: 1.02ex;" src="images/38.svg" alt=" " data-tex="a">, passing through a lens,
fell on <img style="vertical-align: -0.025ex; width: 0.971ex; height: 1.595ex;" src="images/6.svg" alt=" " data-tex="b"> so as to be in part reflected to <img style="vertical-align: -0.8ex; width: 2.164ex; height: 2.37ex;" src="images/52.svg" alt=" " data-tex="d_{/}">; the two pencils

were observed by the telescope <img style="vertical-align: -0.464ex; width: 1.244ex; height: 2.059ex;" src="images/49.svg" alt=" " data-tex="f">. Both <img style="vertical-align: -0.464ex; width: 1.244ex; height: 2.059ex;" src="images/49.svg" alt=" " data-tex="f"> and <img style="vertical-align: -0.023ex; width: 1.197ex; height: 1.02ex;" src="images/38.svg" alt=" " data-tex="a"> revolved with the
stone. The mirrors were of speculum metal carefully worked to optically
plane surfaces five centimeters in diameter, and the glasses <img style="vertical-align: -0.025ex; width: 0.971ex; height: 1.595ex;" src="images/6.svg" alt=" " data-tex="b"> and
<img style="vertical-align: -0.025ex; width: 0.98ex; height: 1.025ex;" src="images/7.svg" alt=" " data-tex="c"> were plane-parallel and of the same thickness,
<img style="vertical-align: -0.05ex; width: 14.837ex; height: 1.563ex;" src="images/55.svg" alt=" " data-tex="1.25\, \text{centimeter}">; their surfaces measured
<img style="vertical-align: -0.05ex; width: 2.891ex; height: 1.557ex;" src="images/56.svg" alt=" " data-tex="5.0"> by <img style="vertical-align: -0.05ex; width: 14.597ex; height: 1.579ex;" src="images/57.svg" alt=" " data-tex="7.5\, \text{centimeters}">. The second of these was placed
in the path of one of the pencils to compensate for the passage of the
other through the same thickness of glass. The whole of the optical
portion of the apparatus was kept covered with a wooden cover to prevent
air currents and rapid changes of temperature.
</p>
<p>
The adjustment was effected as follows:&mdash;The mirrors having been
adjusted by screws in the castings which held the mirrors, against which
they were pressed by springs, till light from both pencils could be seen
in the telescope, the lengths of the two paths were measured by a light
wooden rod reaching diagonally from mirror to mirror, the distance being
read from a small steel scale to tenths of millimeters. The difference
in the lengths of the two paths was then annulled by moving the mirror
<img style="vertical-align: -0.8ex; width: 2.042ex; height: 1.8ex;" src="images/54.svg" alt=" " data-tex="e_{/}">. This mirror had three adjustments; it had an adjustment in
altitude and one in azimuth, like all the other mirrors, but finer; it
also had an adjustment in the direction of the incident ray, sliding
forward or backward, but keeping very accurately parallel to its former
plane. The three adjustments of this mirror could be made with the
wooden cover in position.
</p>
<p>
The paths being now approximately equal, the two images of the source of
light or of some well-defined object placed in front of the condensing
lens, were made to coincide, the telescope was now adjusted for distinct
vision of the expected interference bands, and sodium light was
substituted for white light, when the interference bands appeared. These
were now made as clear as possible by adjusting the mirror <img style="vertical-align: -0.8ex; width: 2.042ex; height: 1.8ex;" src="images/54.svg" alt=" " data-tex="e_{/}">;
then white light was restored, the screw altering the length of path was
very slowly moved (one turn of a screw of one hundred threads to the
inch altering the path nearly <img style="vertical-align: -0.466ex; width: 16.919ex; height: 2.036ex;" src="images/58.svg" alt=" " data-tex="1000\, \text{wavelengths}"> till the
colored interference fringes reappeared in white light. These were now
given a convenient width and position, and the apparatus was ready for
observation.
</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<a id="figure05"></a>
<br>
<img src="images/figure05.jpg" class="figcenter" width="300" alt="fig05">
<div class="caption">
<p>Fig. 5.</p>
</div></div>

<p>
The observations were conducted as follows:&mdash;Around the cast-iron
trough were sixteen equidistant marks. The apparatus was revolved very
slowly (one turn in six minutes) and after a few minutes the cross wire
of the micrometer was set on the clearest of the interference fringes at
the instant of passing one of the marks. The motion was so slow that
this could be done readily and accurately. The reading of the screw-head
on the micrometer was noted, and a very slight and gradual impulse was
given to keep up the motion of the stone; on passing the second mark,
the same process was repeated, and this was continued till the apparatus
had completed six revolutions. It was found that by keeping the
apparatus in slow uniform motion, the results were much more uniform and
consistent than when the stone was brought to rest for every
observation; for the effects of strains could be noted for at least half
a minute after the stone came to rest, and during this time effects of
change of temperature came into action.
</p>
<p>
The following tables give the means of the six readings; the first, for
observations made near noon, the second, those near six o'clock in the
evening. The readings are divisions of the screw-heads. The width of the
fringes varied from <img style="vertical-align: -0.05ex; width: 16.181ex; height: 1.62ex;" src="images/59.svg" alt=" " data-tex="40\, \text{to}\, 60\, \text{divisions}">,
the mean value being near <img style="vertical-align: -0.05ex; width: 2.262ex; height: 1.557ex;" src="images/60.svg" alt=" " data-tex="50">, so that one division means

was contrary to, and in the evening observations, with, that of the hands
of a watch.

The upper is the curve for the observations at noon, and the lower that
for the evening observations. The dotted curves represent <i>one
eighth</i> of the theoretical displacements. It seems fair to conclude
from the figure that if there is any displacement due to the relative
motion of the earth and the luminiferous æther, this cannot be much
greater than <img style="vertical-align: -0.05ex; width: 4.023ex; height: 1.557ex;" src="images/62.svg" alt=" " data-tex="0.01"> of the distance between the fringes.
</p>
<p>
Considering the motion of the earth in its orbit only, this displacement
should be
<span class="align-center"><img style="vertical-align: -0.889ex; width: 19.935ex; height: 3.114ex;" src="images/63.svg" alt=" " data-tex="
2D\tfrac{v^{2}}{V^{2}}=2D\times 10^{-8}.
"></span>
The distance D was about eleven meters, or
<img style="vertical-align: -0.466ex; width: 20.294ex; height: 2.437ex;" src="images/64.svg" alt=" " data-tex="2 \times 10^{7}\, \text{wave-lengths}"> of yellow light; hence the
displacement to be expected was <img style="vertical-align: -0.466ex; width: 8.871ex; height: 2.061ex;" src="images/65.svg" alt=" " data-tex="0.4\, \text{fringe}">. The actual
displacement was certainly less than the twentieth part of this, and
probably less than the fortieth part. But since the displacement is
proportional to the square of the velocity, the relative velocity of the
earth and the  æther is probably less than one sixth the earth's orbital
velocity, and certainly less than one-fourth.


</p>
<p>
In what precedes, only the orbital motion of the earth is considered. If
this is combined with the motion of the solar system, concerning which
but little is known with certainty, the result would have to be
modified; and it is just possible that the resultant velocity at the
time of the observations was small though the chances are much against
it. The experiment will therefore be repeated at intervals of three
months, and thus all uncertainty will be avoided.
</p>
<p>
It appears, from all that precedes, reasonably certain that if there be
any relative motion between the earth and the luminiferous æther, it
must be small; quite small enough entirely to refute Fresnel's
explanation of aberration. Stokes has given a theory of aberration which
assumes the æther at the earth's surface to be at rest with regard to
the latter, and only requires in addition that the relative velocity
have a potential; but Lorentz shows that these conditions are
incompatible. Lorentz then proposes a modification which combines some
ideas of Stokes and Fresnel, and assumes the existence of a potential,
together with Fresnel's coefficient. If now it were legitimate to
conclude from the present work that the æther is at rest with regard to
the earth's surface, according to Lorentz there could not be a velocity
potential, and his own theory also fails.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p class="center"><i>Supplement.</i><p>

<p>
It is obvious from what has gone before that it would be hopeless to
attempt to solve the question of the motion of the solar system by
observations of optical phenomena <i>at the surface of the earth</i>. But
it is not impossible that at even moderate distances above the level of the
sea, at the top of an isolated mountain peak, for instance, the relative
motion might be perceptible in an apparatus like that used in these
experiments. Perhaps if the experiment should ever be tried in these
circumstances, the cover should be of glass, or should be removed.
</p>
<p>
It may be worth while to notice another method for multiplying the
square of the aberration sufficiently to bring it within the range of
observation, which has presented itself during the preparation of this
paper. This is founded on the fact that reflection from surfaces in
motion varies from the ordinary laws of reflection.

<p>
Now let the light fall on a parallel mirror facing the first, we should
then have

and the total deviation would be

where <img style="vertical-align: -0.489ex; width: 1.17ex; height: 1.489ex;" src="images/86.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\rho"> is the angle of aberration, if only the orbital motion of
the earth is considered. The maximum displacement obtained by revolving the
whole apparatus through <img style="vertical-align: -0.05ex; width: 3.226ex; height: 1.645ex;" src="images/33.svg" alt=" " data-tex="90^{o}"> would be

With fifty such couples the displacement would be <img style="vertical-align: -0.05ex; width: 2.891ex; height: 1.557ex;" src="images/88.svg" alt=" " data-tex="0.2"><code>''</code>.
But astronomical observations in circumstances far less favorable than
those in which these may be taken have been made to hundredths of a second;
so that this new method bids fair to be at least as sensitive as the former.
</p>
<p>
The arrangement of apparatus might be as in fig. 2
(<a href="#figure07">Figure 07</a>); <img style="vertical-align: -0.023ex; width: 1.061ex; height: 1.023ex;" src="images/89.svg" alt=" " data-tex="s">, in the focus of the lens <img style="vertical-align: -0.023ex; width: 1.197ex; height: 1.02ex;" src="images/38.svg" alt=" " data-tex="a">,
is a slit. <img style="vertical-align: -0.8ex; width: 5.876ex; height: 2.37ex;" src="images/90.svg" alt=" " data-tex="bb_{/}cc_{/}"> are two glass mirrors optically plane and
so silvered as to allow say one twentieth of the light to pass through,
and reflecting say ninety per cent. The intensity of the light falling
on the observing telescope <img style="vertical-align: -0.464ex; width: 2.421ex; height: 2.059ex;" src="images/91.svg" alt=" " data-tex="df"> would be about one millionth of the
original intensity, so that if sunlight or the electric arc were used it
could still be readily seen. The mirrors <img style="vertical-align: -0.8ex; width: 2.929ex; height: 2.37ex;" src="images/92.svg" alt=" " data-tex="bb_{/}"> and <img style="vertical-align: -0.8ex; width: 2.947ex; height: 1.8ex;" src="images/93.svg" alt=" " data-tex="cc_{/}">, would
differ from parallelism sufficiently to separate the successive images.
Finally, the apparatus need not be mounted so as to revolve, as the earth's
rotation would be sufficient.
</p>
<p>
If it were possible to measure with sufficient accuracy the velocity of
light without returning the ray to its starting point, the problem of
measuring the first power of the relative velocity of the earth with
respect to the æther would be solved. This may not be as hopeless as
might appear at first sight, since the difficulties are entirely
mechanical and may possibly be surmounted in the course of time.
</p>
<p>
For example, suppose (fig. 3 (<a href="#figure07">Figure 07</a>)) <img style="vertical-align: -0.025ex; width: 1.986ex; height: 1.025ex;" src="images/94.svg" alt=" " data-tex="m"> and
<img style="vertical-align: -0.8ex; width: 2.974ex; height: 1.8ex;" src="images/95.svg" alt=" " data-tex="m_{/}">, two mirrors revolving with equal velocity in opposite
directions. It is evident that light from <img style="vertical-align: -0.023ex; width: 1.061ex; height: 1.023ex;" src="images/89.svg" alt=" " data-tex="s"> will form a stationary
image at <img style="vertical-align: -0.8ex; width: 2.049ex; height: 1.8ex;" src="images/96.svg" alt=" " data-tex="s_{/}"> and similarly light from <img style="vertical-align: -0.8ex; width: 2.049ex; height: 1.8ex;" src="images/96.svg" alt=" " data-tex="s_{/}"> will form a
stationary image at <img style="vertical-align: -0.023ex; width: 1.061ex; height: 1.023ex;" src="images/89.svg" alt=" " data-tex="s">. If now the velocity of the mirrors be increased
sufficiently, their phases still being exactly the same, both images will
be deflected from <img style="vertical-align: -0.023ex; width: 1.061ex; height: 1.023ex;" src="images/89.svg" alt=" " data-tex="s"> and <img style="vertical-align: -0.8ex; width: 2.049ex; height: 1.8ex;" src="images/96.svg" alt=" " data-tex="s_{/}">, in inverse proportion to the
velocities of light in the two directions; or, if the two deflections are
made equal, and the difference of phase of the mirrors be simultaneously
measured, this will evidently be proportional to the difference of
velocity in the two directions. The only real difficulty lies in this
measurement. The following is perhaps a possible solution.
</p>
<p>
<img style="vertical-align: -0.8ex; width: 3.146ex; height: 1.8ex;" src="images/97.svg" alt=" " data-tex="gg_{/}"> (fig. 4 (<a href="#figure07">Figure 07</a>)) are two gratings on
which sunlight is concentrated. These are placed so that after falling on
the revolving mirrors <img style="vertical-align: -0.025ex; width: 1.986ex; height: 1.025ex;" src="images/94.svg" alt=" " data-tex="m"> and <img style="vertical-align: -0.8ex; width: 2.974ex; height: 1.8ex;" src="images/95.svg" alt=" " data-tex="m_{/}">, the light forms images of the
gratings at <img style="vertical-align: -0.023ex; width: 1.061ex; height: 1.023ex;" src="images/89.svg" alt=" " data-tex="s"> and <img style="vertical-align: -0.8ex; width: 2.049ex; height: 1.8ex;" src="images/96.svg" alt=" " data-tex="s_{/}">, two very sensitive selenium cells in
circuit with a battery and a telephone. If everything be symmetrical,
the sound in the telephone will be a maximum. If now one of the slits <img style="vertical-align: -0.023ex; width: 1.061ex; height: 1.023ex;" src="images/89.svg" alt=" " data-tex="s">
be displaced through half the distance between the image of the grating
bars, there will be silence. Suppose now that the two deflections having
been made exactly equal, the slit is adjusted for silence. Then if the
experiment be repeated when the earth's rotation has turned the whole
apparatus through <img style="vertical-align: -0.05ex; width: 4.357ex; height: 1.645ex;" src="images/98.svg" alt=" " data-tex="180^{o}">, and the deflections are again made equal,
there will no longer be silence, and the angular distance through which
<img style="vertical-align: -0.023ex; width: 1.061ex; height: 1.023ex;" src="images/89.svg" alt=" " data-tex="s"> must be moved to restore silence will measure the required difference
in phase.
</p>
<p>
There remain three other methods, all astronomical, for attacking the
problem of the motion of the solar system through space.
</p>
<p>
1. The telescopic observation of the proper motions of the stars. This
has given us a highly probably determination of the direction of this
motion, but only a guess as to its amount.
</p>
<p>
2. The spectroscopic observation of the motion of stars in the line of
sight. This could furnish data for the relative motions only, though it
seems likely that by the immense improvements in the photography of
stellar spectra, the information thus obtained will be far more accurate
than any other.
</p>
<p>
3. Finally there remains the determination of the velocity of light by
observations of the eclipses of Jupiter's satellites. If the improved
photometric methods practiced at the Harvard observatory make it
possible to observe these with sufficient accuracy, the difference in
the results found for the velocity of light when Jupiter is nearest to
and farthest from the line of motion will give, not merely the motion of
the solar system with reference to the stars, but with reference to the
luminiferous æther itself.
